# 🚀 Quick GCP Setup Guide

Since you've tested the demo and it's working great, let's get the full LINE Mini App deployed to GCP!

## 🎯 What You'll Get After Setup

✅ **Production URL**: `https://your-project.web.app`  
✅ **LINE LIFF Integration**: Login with LINE accounts  
✅ **Group Notifications**: Rich messages in LINE groups  
✅ **Auto-scaling Backend**: Google App Engine  
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Push to deploy automatically  

## ⚡ Quick Setup Steps

### 1️⃣ Create GCP Project (2 minutes)
```bash
# Set project name
PROJECT_ID="sales-tracker-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
echo "Creating project: $PROJECT_ID"

# Create project
gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID --name="Sales Tracker"
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable appengine.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com firebase.googleapis.com
```

### 2️⃣ Setup Firebase (1 minute)
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login and connect project
firebase login
firebase projects:addfirebase $PROJECT_ID
```

### 3️⃣ Deploy to Production (1 minute)
```bash
# Deploy frontend to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Your app will be live at: https://$PROJECT_ID.web.app
```

### 4️⃣ Setup CI/CD (Optional)
- Add GitHub secrets for automatic deployment
- Every push to main = auto-deploy

## 🟢 LINE Integration Setup

### After GCP deployment:
1. **Get your live URL**: `https://your-project.web.app`
