# Fixes Summary

## 1. ✅ Fixed Aggressive PWA Caching

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `sw.js` with dynamic cache naming using timestamp
- Implemented network-first strategy for all requests
- Added cache versioning that matches app version (3.7.9)
- API routes always fetch fresh data
- Added message handlers for cache control
- Service worker now notifies clients on updates

**Key Improvements:**
- Cache name includes timestamp: `sales-tracker-v3.7.9-${Date.now()}`
- Aggressive cleanup of old caches on activation
- Network-first approach prevents stale content
- Clients receive update notifications via postMessage

## 2. ✅ Demo Mode Already Disabled

**Current State:**
- Frontend: `enterDemoMode()` function shows error "Demo mode is disabled. Please use LINE login."
- Backend: No demo/mock data functionality exists
- Config: Production API URL is correctly set
- All data comes from real backend (no local/mock data)

**No Changes Needed** - Demo mode was already properly disabled.

## 3. ✅ Database IS Shared for Team Leaderboard

**Verification Results:**
- Firestore collections are shared across ALL users
- Activities collection stores all team members' activities
- Leaderboard queries aggregate data from all users
- Team stats calculate points across entire team

**How It Works:**
1. Each activity is stored with the user's `lineUserId`
2. Leaderboard queries fetch activities from ALL users
3. Results are aggregated and sorted by points
4. Top performers from entire team are displayed

**Example Query Flow:**
```javascript
// Gets activities from ALL users for daily leaderboard
query = collections.activities.where('date', '==', targetDate);
// Then aggregates by user and sorts by points
```

## Summary

All three issues have been addressed:
1. **Caching** - Fixed with aggressive cache busting and network-first strategy
2. **Demo Mode** - Already disabled, no action needed
3. **Team Database** - Already shared, leaderboard shows all team members

The app is properly configured for production use with:
- Real-time team leaderboard
- No demo/mock data
- Improved caching strategy that prevents stale content
