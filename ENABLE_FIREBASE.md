# Enable Firebase for Your GCP Project

## Quick Steps to Enable Firebase:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**:
   ðŸ‘‰ https://console.firebase.google.com/

2. **Click "Add project"**

3. **Select your existing GCP project**:
   - You'll see "salesappfkt" in the list
   - Select it and click "Continue"

4. **Enable Google Analytics** (Optional):
   - You can skip this if you don't need analytics
   - Click "Continue" or "Skip"

5. **Click "Add Firebase"**

This will enable Firebase services for your GCP project.

## After Firebase is Enabled:

```bash
firebase use salesappfkt
```
